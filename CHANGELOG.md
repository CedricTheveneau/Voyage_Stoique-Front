## Changelog
**Aug. 19th 2024** : Ditched everything there was in the repository (a react app created with vite) in favor of a next.js app.
The change was made because next apps are far more SEO friendly and tend to have better performance. Next is also even easier to use than React and provides much more powerful tools, its use made a lot more sense to me for a more serious app.
